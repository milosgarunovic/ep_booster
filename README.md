KiCad project for EP Booster

---

The idea with this project is to have it in one place, with some "standards" like to view everything
in KiCad and export for manufacturing.

As a bassist, I'm using EP Booster as always on pedal in vintage mode without a boost, and it gives
a nice warmth to my custom bass with jazz pickups, and better thump with my Squier VM Precision with
Wilde P-46 pickup.

What I want to do as a first version is to have the whole thing as a pedal, and then strip away the
parts that are for boost and just leave the vintage part in there so I can put it into my basses,
thus removing one pedal from signal chain.
