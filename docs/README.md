KiCad project for EP Booster

---

The idea with this project is to have it in one place, with some "standards" like to view everything in KiCad and export
for manufacturing.

As a bassist, I'm using EP Booster as always on pedal in vintage mode without a boost, and it gives a nice warmth to my
custom bass with jazz pickups, and better thump with my Squier VM Precision with Wilde P-46 pickup.

What I want to do as a first version is to have the whole thing working the same as my EP Booster 70th Thomann
Aniversiry, and then strip away the parts that are for boost and just leave the vintage part in there so I can put it
into my basses, thus removing one pedal from signal chain.

I guess the eq part will last a long time in bass, since I was running it as a pedal for 3-4 months as always on
on battery, and with stripped components (especially LED), it should last even longer. I'll have to do measurements
and write that here.

I've copied the AionFx to KiCad but without R15 and LED1 since I'm not planning to put that into the bass, but that
can be added later, and we can just bypass it, or rather not use it.
